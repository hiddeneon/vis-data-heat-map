# Monthly Global Land-Surface Temperature Heat Map

This interactive heat map visualizes the monthly global land-surface temperature anomalies from 1753 to the 2015. Each cell represents a month and year, with color coding based on temperature deviation from a base temperature.

## Features

- **Heat Map**: Displays the temperature anomalies for each month from 1880 to the present, with color coding to indicate temperature variations.

- **Tooltip**: On hover, displays detailed information about the year, month, and temperature.

- **Legend**: A color legend showing the corresponding temperature ranges for the heat map.

## How to Use

1. Hover over any cell on the heat map to view the temperature data for that month and year.

2. The color of the cell indicates the temperature deviation, and a tooltip will display the exact temperature.
